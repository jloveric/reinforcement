# reinforcement
Generic c++20 reinforcement learning library.  Major WIP (work in progress) to get some experience in RL.  As of this writing c++20 modules are still
too buggy so resorting to header files!

make
```
and then run
```
./reinforce
```
run the tests
```
ctest
```
gonna need boost for testing
